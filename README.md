# simple linux distro
This is a very simple linux distro used for experimentation and research purpose and is not recommended for any other use!
This distro does support networking but it is not tested and many other features of Linux may not we available in this distro.
This distro is my hobby project and any support or maintenance is not guaranteed.

I would like to thank GOD first for helping me in making this project and i would like to give heartfelt thank you to Mr.Nir Lichtman for providing the world with wonderful knowledge on how to create a simple Linux distro from scratch in his youtube channel and without his video i would not be able to create this project! Here is a link to his video on how to create a simple Linux distro from scratch if you would like to visit his youtube channel!
